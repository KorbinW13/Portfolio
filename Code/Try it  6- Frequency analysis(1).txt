What to add. 
Currently the code only processes lower case letters. 
Add symbols for space ‘  ‘, comma ‘,’ and period ‘.’     (3 points) 
Print the total number of frequencies of all of the alphabets  (3 points) 
Write a function to convert upper case letters to lower case letters. Allow the code to accept both upper and lower case letters but you can treat them equally so you can 
convert the uppercase to lowercase before processing (5 points) 
Write a function to Calculate and print the percentage of each frequency showing as two decimal places ( 5 points) 
Describe the common use of frequency analysis in cyber security applications (4 points)
