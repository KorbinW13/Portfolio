/****************************************************************************************************
Average of Values
To get the average of a series of values, you add the values up and then divide the sum by the number of values. 
Write a program that stores the following values in five different variables: 28, 32, 37, 24, and 33. 
The program should first calculate the sum of these five variables and store the result in a separate variable named sum. 
Then, the program should divide the sum variable by 5 to get the average. Display the average on the screen. 
TIP:Use the double data type for all variables in this program.

Sample output:
Average of 28, 32, 37, 24, and 33 is 30.8
